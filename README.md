This repository contains the research material and codebase for my bachelor's thesis:
- **Optimising Metal and Mineral Recovery from Waste Streams** (Mid Sweden University, 2025)

Please see my thesis report for the full context. 

- The data exploration file shows my method of working, both in the exploratory stage and the programmatic methodology.
- The models_scalers directory includes all the individual models, and scalers for each predictors and response combination.
- main.py is the API for the full model, built with FastAPI, which takes a .csv file with predictors as an input and returns a full predicted dataset.

- This API is deployed on Render, though not currently active.

I'm happy to discuss any questions regarding the project.
